# Strategic Solutions Consulting Website

A modern, fast-loading static website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS and designed to deploy on **Firebase Hosting** with zero-ops maintenance. The site is maintained in Cursor AI and version-controlled on GitHub so that every change can be previewed and rolled back.

## 🚀 How to deploy (quick start)

### 1 · Install prerequisites
1. Node ≥ 18 (https://nodejs.org)
2. Firebase CLI
```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```
3. Git + GitHub account

### 2 · Clone & set up the repo
```bash
# Fork or clone your GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
cd <YOUR_REPO>
```

### 3 · Login & initialise Firebase Hosting
```bash
firebase login               # opens a browser for Google auth
firebase init hosting         # select ➤ Create new project ➤ configure as SPA? (y/n) ➤ set public directory to "public"
```
This creates `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, and the GitHub Action.

### 4 · One-time deploy (manual)
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
Your site will be available at the provided `.web.app` & `.firebaseapp.com` URLs.

### 5 · Continuous deployment from GitHub (recommended)
1. Push the generated workflow file:
```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: initialise Firebase Hosting"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. In the repo Settings → Secrets → Actions, add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` generated in the Firebase console (Hosting → GitHub Action → **Create service account**).
3. Every subsequent push to `main` will:
   * build (if you add an SSG later),
   * deploy to a preview channel,
   * then promote to production.

### 6 · Custom domain (Namecheap)
Follow **Hosting → Add custom domain** in the Firebase console, then add the given records in Namecheap:
| Record | Host | Value |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| TXT    | @    | (verification string) |
| A      | @    | 199.36.158.100 |
| A      | www  | 199.36.158.100 |
After propagation (5-30 min) Firebase will provision HTTPS for you.

## 🛠 Local development
Because the site is pure static files you can use any dev server:
```bash
npx serve public --listen 4000   # opens http://localhost:4000
```
Edit files in `src/`, then copy/build into `public/` (or configure your SSG to output there).
