## Current Implementation: Trust Gradient with Bathymetry Enhancement

The current website uses the **Trust Gradient** approach enhanced with:

- **Bathymetry Visual Background**: Sophisticated SVG background that creates depth and visual interest while supporting the "systematic depth" metaphor
- **Cube Icon Integration**: Custom SVG icons representing People, Process, and Tools dimensions
- **Progressive Trust Building**: Moving from problem identification to solution presentation to authority establishment
- **Local Market Focus**: Specific BC SMB language and examples throughout

### Key Messaging Evolution

**Hero Section**: "Stuck in Operational Quicksand?" remains the primary hook, supported by the bathymetry background that visually reinforces the concept of systematic depth and layers.

**Core Elements Section**: Evolved from "Three Pillars" to "Pragmatic Core Elements" to better align with the cube logo and avoid "our" language.

**Problem Section**: Uses icons and structured layout to make pain points easily scannable and relatable.

## Recommendations for Continued Development

1. **A/B Testing Opportunities**: Test different opening messages within the trust gradient structure
2. **Content Depth**: Develop downloadable resources that support each structural approach
3. **Local Case Studies**: Expand BC-specific examples and testimonials
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure all structural approaches work effectively on mobile devices
5. **Conversion Tracking**: Implement analytics to measure which structural elements drive the best engagement

## Next Steps

The current bathymetry-enhanced trust gradient approach provides a strong foundation. Future iterations could:

- Test results-first messaging for warm traffic
- Develop problem-focused landing pages for specific pain points
- Create industry-specific versions of the core messaging
- Implement progressive disclosure based on visitor engagement level
