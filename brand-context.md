# Brand Context — Pragmatic Tactics

## Voice

- Direct, no-nonsense, warm but not soft
- Speaks like a peer, not a consultant or coach
- No jargon, no frameworks, no consulting-speak
- Specific over clever — real situations over marketing language
- Confident without being pushy — states what it is, doesn't oversell

### Words to Avoid
- **consulting / consultant** — feels corporate and distant
- **hands-on** — overpromises direct implementation; these services are preparatory and guided
- **coaching** — too soft, implies mindset work over operational change
- **transform / transformation** — overused, vague
- **leverage** — corporate jargon
- **synergy** — obviously
- **holistic** — too wellness-coded
- **optimize** (in headlines) — acceptable in technical context, not in positioning

### Preferred Alternatives
- "consulting" → services, work, engagement, support
- "hands-on" → guided, structured, step-by-step, practical
- "implement" (when Greg does it) → guide, support, prepare, set up
- "roadmap" (as a formal deliverable) → prioritized plan, action plan, prioritized list
- "diagnostic" → opportunities assessment, review

## Services

### Owner Tactics — 8-Week Engagement ($750 CAD)
**What it actually is:** Greg guides overwhelmed owners through identifying what's eating their
time and finding right-fit solutions. He researches tools, evaluates options, and prepares
resources between sessions. The owner self-implements quick wins with Greg's guidance throughout.
Solutions Greg doesn't get to in 8 weeks are captured in a prioritized backlog.

**Who it's for:** Owners/leaders who are too deep in daily operations to focus on what actually
matters. They know something's off but don't have the bandwidth to even think about it. They
need someone to help them get traction from zero.

**Key differentiator:** Not just sessions — Greg does research, tool evaluation, and solution
development between every call. Reserved capacity for scoped project work if a bigger need
surfaces.

**What they walk away with:**
- Clarity on what can win their time back
- Quick wins already in place (guided, not done-for-them)
- Practical AI literacy
- Broader operational awareness across their business
- A prioritized action plan (not a template)

### Discovery — Fixed-Price Assessment ($800 CAD)
**What it actually is:** A low-commitment entry point for owners who already have some direction.
It's a gateway to working with Pragmatic Tactics — tests the fit, delivers real value, and
prepares Greg to understand the business so he can deliver value sooner in future project work.

**Who it's for:** Owners/leaders who are past awareness. They may have worked with coaches,
have a strategy forming, know automation and systemization are possible — but need help scoping
what to tackle first and whether Pragmatic Tactics is the right fit.

**Key differentiator:** Not a one-time deliverable that sits on a shelf. It's a foundation for
deeper work that also stands on its own as an actionable output.

**What they walk away with:**
- Opportunities assessment + prioritized roadmap
- A foundation for scoped project work
- Confidence in whether the working relationship fits

## Audience

**Who they are:** Small business owners and leaders (5-50 employees) in trades, manufacturing,
e-commerce, and product-based businesses. Based in or near Revelstoke, BC, or anywhere in
Canada (remote).

**What state they're in:** Two scenarios:
1. **Buried** — wearing too many hats, can't carve out headspace, knows things are broken but
   can't start fixing them (→ Owner Tactics)
2. **Ready** — past awareness, has some direction, ready to scope real changes but needs help
   figuring out what solutions fit (→ Discovery)

**How they search:** They search their pain, not a service category:
- "too many hats small business"
- "overwhelmed business owner"
- "how to streamline my business"
- "how to automate my business"
- They do NOT search "workflow optimization" or "operations consultant"

## Positioning

- These services are **preparatory** — they set the stage for real operational change
- The real value is the **foundation for future work together**, not just a deliverable
- Greg is not a coach and not a traditional consultant — he's a practical operator who
  researches, evaluates, and prepares solutions for the owner to implement
- Both services lead naturally into scoped project work, but there's no obligation
- Pricing is transparent, outcomes are specific, language is plain
