# Owner Tactics — Launch Copy

---

## 1A. Email to Caroline (Chamber Director)

**Subject:** Quick ask — know any owners (or leaders) who'd be a fit?

Hi Caroline,

Hope things are good on your end.

I wanted to loop you in on something. I'm launching a new 1-on-1 consulting engagement called **Owner Tactics** — it's specifically for Revelstoke business owners with small teams (3–20 people) who know things need to change operationally but don't know where to start.

It's 8 weeks, and it's hands-on — not coaching, not a course. I work with them to figure out where their time is actually going, what's underused, what's broken, and we start fixing things during the engagement. The implementation is based on what they can handle internally with guidance versus what they need additional support for. They walk away with quick wins already in place, some of their own time back, and a roadmap to keep developing independently or with external support.

I'm running a pilot cohort at $750 (future pricing will be $1,000+), limited to 5 spots, so I can give each person proper attention and reserve capacity for deeper work if needed.

**Here's my ask:** you talk to local business owners every day. If anyone comes to mind who's stretched thin, wearing too many hats, or keeps saying "I know I need to get organized" — I'd love an introduction. Even just a name and I'll take it from there.

Here's the page if you want to take a look: [pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics](https://pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics)

Goes without saying that your feedback is also appreciated, and I'd be happy to grab a coffee and walk you through it if that's easier.

Thanks Caroline,
Greg

## 1B. Email to Hand-Picked Chamber Members — Version A (From Greg, mentioning Caroline)

**Subject:** Caroline suggested I reach out — quick question about your operations

Hi [First Name],

Caroline [last name] at the Chamber mentioned you might be a good fit for something I'm putting together, so I wanted to reach out directly.

I'm Greg Fortier — I run Pragmatic Tactics here in Revelstoke. I'm launching a new 1-on-1 engagement called **Owner Tactics** for local business owners who are stretched thin and know their operations need work but aren't sure where to focus.

Over 8 weeks, I work with you to figure out what's eating your time — tools you're underusing, things that still run through you that shouldn't, processes that are more manual than they need to be. We also look at where AI and newer tools can genuinely help (and where they can't). The implementation is based on what you can handle internally with guidance versus what you need additional support for. Not theory. Actual changes during the engagement, plus a roadmap to keep developing independently or with support.

I'm running a small pilot cohort (5 spots, $750) to keep things focused and hands-on.

If any of that sounds relevant, I'd love to have a quick conversation — no pitch, just to see if it's a fit. You can also take a look here: [pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics](https://pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics)

Either way, appreciate your time.

## 1C. Email to Hand-Picked Chamber Members — Version B (For Caroline to Forward)

**Subject:** Thought of you for this — Greg Fortier's new program for local business owners

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to pass this along because I think it could be a great fit for you.

Greg Fortier (Pragmatic Tactics, whom you may be familiar with as the founder of Trapper Snowboards) is running a hands-on program called **Owner Tactics** for Revelstoke business owners with small teams. It's 8 weeks of 1-on-1 work where he digs into your operations — where your time is going, what tools are being underused, what you can delegate, and where things like AI might actually fit. The implementation is based on what you can handle internally with guidance versus what you need additional support for. You walk away with quick wins in place and a roadmap to keep building on.

He's doing a small pilot cohort right now — 5 spots at $750 — so it's very limited.

If you've ever said "I know things need to change, I just don't know where to start," this is built exactly for that.

Here's the page: [pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics](https://pragmatictactics.com/services/owner-tactics)

I'll let Greg share the details — feel free to reach out to him directly at greg@pragmatictactics.com.

## 2. Facebook Post (Personal Network — Referral Ask)

Asking for a favour, Revelstoke.

I've been working on something for local business owners and I'm looking for the right people.

**Owner Tactics** is an 8-week, 1-on-1 engagement for owners with small teams (3–20 people) who know things need to change but aren't sure where to focus. We dig into where your time is actually going — tools you're paying for but barely using, things that still run through you that shouldn't, processes that are way more manual than they need to be — including where AI and modern tools can genuinely help versus where they're just noise. The implementation is based on what they can handle internally with guidance versus what needs additional support. Not a course. Not coaching. Real changes, during the engagement, plus a roadmap to keep building on.

I'm running a pilot cohort right now: **5 spots at $750** (pilot pricing — it's going up after this).

**If you know a business owner in Revelstoke who's stretched thin and could use a fresh set of eyes on how they're running things, I'd really appreciate you sending this their way.** Remote is also an option if they're not always in town.

Link in the comments for anyone who wants to take a look or pass it along.

## 3. LinkedIn Post

Most small business owners I talk to say some version of the same thing:

*"I know things need to change. I just don't know where to start."*

They're involved in every decision. Their team can't move without them. They're paying for tools they barely use. They know there's a better way — they just don't have the time to figure it out.

That's why I built **Owner Tactics**.

It's an 8-week, 1-on-1 engagement for business owners with small teams (3–20 people). No courses. No slide decks. I work directly with the owner to figure out where their time and energy is actually going, what's broken or underused, and where AI and modern tools can genuinely move the needle versus where they're just noise. The implementation is based on what you can handle internally with guidance versus what you need additional support for. Real fixes go in place during the engagement, not after.

They walk away with:
→ Quick wins already implemented
→ A roadmap to keep developing independently or with support
→ Clarity on what to delegate, what to automate, and what to stop paying for

I think like a manufacturer — every operation has waste, bottlenecks, and untapped capacity. Whether it's a shop floor or a 10-person service company, the approach is the same: find the constraint, fix it, move on.

I'm running a pilot cohort out of Revelstoke, BC right now — 5 spots at $750 (pilot pricing). Remote is available for anyone outside the area.
