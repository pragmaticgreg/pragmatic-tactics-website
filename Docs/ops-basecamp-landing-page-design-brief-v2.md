# Ops Basecamp — Landing Page Design Brief (v2)
## Updated with conversion research findings

**Project:** Ops Basecamp landing page  
**Purpose:** Inform and convert local business owners to enroll in the pilot program  
**Payment:** Already handled externally — this page drives to an existing payment/enrollment flow  
**Page URL:** `/ops-basecamp`

---

## Page Philosophy

Short, scannable, and confident. The reader should understand what this is within 10 seconds and be able to go deeper on anything that interests them. Default state is concise — detail lives inside expandable/collapsible sections. No walls of text. No jargon. Speak like a human who runs businesses, not a consultant selling frameworks.

This page needs to replace a sales call. At $750 with no call required, the page itself must build enough trust and clarity for someone to commit. The audience is warm (arriving via direct link, text, DM, word of mouth) but still needs to feel confident in what they're buying.

---

## Target Audience

Small business owners and leaders in Revelstoke, BC with teams of 3–20 people. Mix of industries — trades, professional services, hospitality, retail, manufacturing. They are:

- Stuck in the day-to-day, involved in every decision
- Struggling to delegate effectively
- Curious about AI and better tools but overwhelmed
- Likely paying for tools they're barely using
- Time-poor, skeptical of "coaching" or consultant-speak

They will likely view this on mobile first. Most will arrive via direct link (text, email, social DM) rather than organic search.

## Page Structure & Components

### 1. Hero Section

**Eyebrow text:** "For Revelstoke Business Owners with Teams of 3–20"  
**Headline:** "Your Business Has Outgrown Your Systems. Let's Fix That."  
**Subheadline:** "8 weeks. 1-on-1. A clear plan built around your business — not a cookie-cutter framework."  
**Primary CTA Button:** "Reserve Your Spot — $750"  
**Micro-copy below CTA:** "Pilot cohort · 6–8 spots · Starts late February 2025"

Keep above the fold: eyebrow, headline, subheadline, CTA, and context line. No more than 3–4 sentences of copy beyond the headline. Use visual pacing (whitespace, one strong image or local context) to balance.

### 2. Pain Points / "Sound Familiar?"

4–6 recognizable statements that feel like the reader's inner monologue. All visible — no accordions.

- "I'm involved in every decision and nothing moves without me"
- "I've tried delegating but it doesn't stick"
- "We're at capacity but I can't just keep hiring"
- "I know we're not using half the tools we're paying for"
- "Everyone's talking about AI but I don't know where to start"
- "I know things need to change — I just don't know what to focus on first"

Keep visually distinct — cards, stacked list, or quote-style blocks.

### 3. What This Is (Program Overview)

Brief paragraph — 3–4 sentences max in the default view. All visible, no accordions. Cover:

- 8-week, 1-on-1 program
- Starts with understanding your business and goals, not a template
- Combines a discovery process with weekly working sessions
- You walk away with a prioritized plan and changes already in motion

This section should feel grounded and no-nonsense.

### 4. What We Work On

**4 category headers with benefit-driven labels, each expandable/collapsible (collapsed by default).** Each shows a one-line hook visible at all times. Expanding reveals 2–4 sentences of detail.

**Categories:**

#### → Leveraging What You Already Have
*Visible hook:* Most businesses are sitting on tools they're barely using. We start there.  
*Expanded:* Before recommending anything new, we look at what's already in place — Google Workspace, project management tools, shared drives, existing subscriptions — and figure out how to actually get value from them. Sometimes the biggest wins come from using what you're already paying for.

#### → AI & Modern Tools — Cut Through the Hype
*Visible hook:* Figure out what's actually useful for your business, not what's trending.  
*Expanded:* Part of the program can include working with you to understand how AI tools can support your own day-to-day as a business leader — from decision-making to communication to planning. We also look at practical use cases for your team: where these tools can reduce repetitive work, improve quality, or free up capacity. The goal isn't to chase trends — it's to find what's genuinely useful for how your business actually operates.

#### → Process & Delegation — Get It Out of Your Head
*Visible hook:* Get what's in your head into a system your team can actually run.  
*Expanded:* We identify the processes that live in the owner's head and work on getting them documented, simplified, or handed off. This might be as straightforward as writing down how something gets done, or restructuring a workflow so it doesn't require your involvement at every step.

#### → Your Team — Do More Without Hiring More
*Visible hook:* Build capacity with the people you already have.  
*Expanded:* Sometimes the bottleneck isn't the process — it's that a key person needs support in a specific area. If a particular function of your business is consuming your time because the team needs constant guidance there, that's something we'd identify and build a plan around.

### 5. How It Works (Timeline)

A simple visual timeline or step sequence. 4 steps, all visible.

1. **Enroll & Kickoff** — Sign up and meet for a 60-minute kickoff session. We cover your goals, your challenges, and how the discovery process works.
2. **Discovery Phase (2 weeks)** — Use a simple voice-capture tool to record what's on your mind — problems, ideas, goals, frustrations. 5–10 minutes a day.
3. **Weekly Working Sessions (5 weeks)** — 60-minute 1-on-1 sessions where we turn discovery into action. Prioritize, plan, and start implementing.
4. **Walk Away With a Plan** — A 90-day roadmap, quick wins already in motion, and clarity on what's next.

**CTA placed after this section.**

### 6. What You Get (Deliverables)

Short list — 4 items. All visible, no accordions.

- A prioritized 90-day operational roadmap built around your business
- Quick wins implemented during the program — not just planned
- Clarity on what to hire, build, or buy next (and what to stop paying for)
- A trusted advisor who knows your business and can help beyond the program

### 7. About Greg

Short founder section — this is the **primary trust signal** for the entire page. No testimonials exist for the pilot, so this section does the heavy lifting.

**Required elements:**
- Photo — real, not a polished corporate headshot. Authentic and on-brand.
- 2–3 sentences covering: who Greg is, that he runs his own businesses (including a manufacturing company), that he's local to Revelstoke, and how he works
- Anti-consultant positioning: he's not a coach, not selling a framework — he's someone who builds things and fixes operations

**Tone guidance:** "I build things and fix operations. I'm not going to sell you a framework or a mindset shift. I've run manufacturing floors, built software, and helped business owners like you figure out what's actually broken — then fix it."

*Note: Greg to provide final bio copy and photo. Placeholder is fine for v1.*

### 8. Pricing & Details

**Single pricing card — no tiers, no "starting at."**

Card contents:
- **$750** (prominent)
- "Pilot Cohort Pricing" label
- What's included: 6 × 60-minute 1-on-1 sessions, 2-week guided discovery phase, custom 90-day operational roadmap, background analysis between sessions
- "Future cohorts: $1,500+"
- Payment: Paid in advance
- Format: In-person in Revelstoke preferred, virtual available

**Value framing line** (near the price): "That's less than $125/session for personalized operational consulting and a custom roadmap."

**Spots remaining indicator:** A simple, manually updatable element showing current availability. "X of 8 spots remaining" — update as enrollments come in. Tied to quality: "Limited to ensure dedicated 1-on-1 focus."

**CTA button repeated here:** "Reserve Your Spot — $750"

### 9. FAQ (Expandable)

Collapsible Q&A format. All collapsed by default.

- **"Is this coaching?"** — Not exactly. It's structured operational work — more like having a fractional ops advisor for 8 weeks. We're focused on your systems, tools, and processes, not mindset.
- **"What industries does this work for?"** — Any. The program is built around your specific business, not a template. Participants will come from different industries — trades, services, retail, hospitality, etc.
- **"Do I need to be tech-savvy?"** — No. The discovery tool is simple voice recording. Everything else we work through together in sessions.
- **"What if we identify something that needs more hands-on help?"** — Great — that's actually a feature. If we find work that goes beyond what your team can handle alone, we can scope additional support separately. The Revelstoke-local format makes this practical.
- **"What's the time commitment?"** — One 60-minute session per week, plus 5–10 minutes per day during the 2-week discovery phase. Manageable for busy owners.
- **"Can I do this virtually?"** — Yes, though in-person in Revelstoke is preferred for this pilot.
- **"Who is this NOT for?"** — Solopreneurs without a team (the leverage isn't there yet), anyone looking for a done-for-you service, or anyone not willing to be honest about what's broken. If that's you, no hard feelings — this just isn't the right fit.

### 10. Final CTA

Closing line + CTA button. Keep it short and direct.

"6–8 spots. First come, first served. Pilot pricing won't last."

**CTA button:** "Reserve Your Spot — $750"

---

## Content & Copy Notes

- **Tone:** Direct, grounded, slightly informal. "Gruff empathy." No buzzwords, no consultant-speak, no hype. Write like someone who's been in the trenches, not someone selling from a stage.
- **Avoid:** "Transform your business," "unlock your potential," "game-changer," "synergy," "scale." Anything that sounds like a LinkedIn influencer. Also avoid "beta" — use "pilot" or "founding cohort."
- **Lean into:** "Fix what's broken," "stop guessing," "do more with what you have," "clarity," "get unstuck."
- **AI messaging:** Present as one of several areas we work on, not the headline. Interesting to explore, not required. Frame as practical, not hype.
- **The word "systems":** Use sparingly and always ground it with a concrete example. Most of our audience doesn't think in terms of "systems" — they think in terms of "I'm doing too much" and "my team can't figure this out without me."
- **"Revelstoke" usage:** Mention naturally 3–4 times in body copy. In the eyebrow text, at least one H2, and in the footer. Don't force it.
