### **1\. The Hero Section**

*Focus entirely on the leader's bandwidth and cutting through the tech noise.*

* **New Headline:** You Can’t Lead Your Team If You’re Buried in Admin. Let’s Fix Your Workflow and Demystify AI.  
* **New Subheadline:** **Owner Tactics** is an 8-week, 1-on-1 engagement specifically for owners and leaders. We aren't touching your team's processes yet. We are completely focused on rescuing *your* schedule, streamlining your personal workflow, and giving you a practical, top-down understanding of how to actually leverage AI.

### **2\. Update the "Sound Familiar?" Section**

*Add the anxiety of falling behind on technology and the reality of bottom-up adoption.*

* *“I’m doing lower-level admin work when I should be developing my team.”*  
* *“Everyone is talking about AI, but I have no idea what it actually means for my specific business.”*  
* *“I suspect my team is already using AI tools on their own, but we have no top-down strategy or oversight.”*  
* *“I know things need to change and adapt, but I literally don't have the time to step back and learn new tools.”*

### **3\. Revamp "What We Work On"**

*This is where we clearly divide the service into "Fixing your time" and "Executive AI Literacy."*

**Focus 1: Reclaiming Your Time (The Workflow Piece)**

* **Header:** Unburdening Your Personal Workflow  
* **Copy:** We look at your specific daily tasks and identify the bottlenecks keeping you in the weeds. We’ll build simple frameworks to get the administrative bloat off your desk, so you can stop being a crutch for your team and start actually leading them.

**Focus 2: Practical AI for the Leader (The AI Piece)**

* **Header:** Executive AI Literacy: Cut Through the Hype  
* **Copy:** We don't just talk about AI; we build your personal competency. We will set up AI tools specifically for *your* day-to-day use so you can understand its capabilities and its limitations firsthand. By learning how to leverage it yourself, you'll be able to clearly see how it can eventually be applied to your wider business operations.

**Focus 3: Gaining Control of the Tech (The Top-Down Piece)**

* **Header:** Moving from Bottom-Up Chaos to Top-Down Strategy  
* **Copy:** Often, new tech adoption starts at the bottom—your employees are likely already experimenting with AI to do their jobs. We will help you understand what they might be using, get a handle on the landscape, and shift you into a position where you can lead a holistic, top-down strategy rather than just reacting to what your team is doing.

### **4\. The Bridge to "Discovery"**

*Clarify exactly where this service ends and the next one begins.*

* **New Copy Addition:** *"Owner Tactics is about getting you, the leader, up to speed and freeing up your capacity. Once you have your time back and a firm understanding of the tools available (like AI), you will finally be in a position to look at the big picture. That’s when you'll be ready for our **Discovery** service, where we map and systemize the rest of the company."*
