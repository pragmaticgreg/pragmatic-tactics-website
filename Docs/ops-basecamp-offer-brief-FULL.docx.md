OFFER BRIEF & PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Prepared January 2025 | Pilot Cohort

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT**

# **Program Overview**

Ops Basecamp is an 8-week, 1-on-1 operational clarity program designed for small business owners in Revelstoke, BC who have teams of 3–20 people and are stuck in the day-to-day. It’s for the owner who knows things need to change but doesn’t know where to start — or keeps starting and stalling.

This is not a course. It’s not group coaching. It’s not a cookie-cutter framework. Every engagement is shaped entirely around the individual participant — their business, their team, their specific challenges, and their goals. We start by listening, then we build a plan around what they actually need.

This is also not a software pitch. We’re not selling tools. In fact, one of the first things we look at is what they already have and aren’t fully using.

# **The Problem We’re Solving**

Most small business owners with teams of 3–20 people share the same set of frustrations. They’re doing too much themselves. Delegation doesn’t stick. They hear about AI and automation but don’t know what’s real and what’s hype. They’ve tried hiring their way out of capacity problems, but more people just means more management overhead.

Underneath all of that is a systems problem. Not a software problem — a systems problem. The business runs on the owner’s memory, instincts, and availability. When any of those hit a limit, everything slows down.

And often, the solutions are closer than they think. Most businesses are already paying for tools they’re barely using — a Google Workspace account that’s just email and a messy shared drive, a ChatGPT subscription that’s only used as a search engine, project management software that nobody adopted. The gap isn’t usually a missing tool. It’s knowing how to use what’s already there, and knowing what to focus on first.

Ops Basecamp helps them see the systems they’re missing, leverage what they already have, prioritize what to fix first, and start making changes — with guidance, not guesswork.

# **Who It’s For**

The ideal participant is a Revelstoke-area business owner or leader who:

* Runs a team of 3–20 people across any industry (trades, professional services, hospitality, retail, manufacturing)

* Feels stuck in the day-to-day and can’t seem to get ahead of it

* Has tried to delegate but it doesn’t stick or the results aren’t right

* Wants to do more with their existing team rather than just hiring more people

* Suspects they’re not getting the most out of the tools and tech they already have

* Is curious about AI, automation, or “systems” but doesn’t know where to start

* Is willing to commit 60 minutes per week plus some light implementation between sessions

## **Who It’s Not For**

* Solopreneurs without a team (the leverage isn’t there yet)

* People looking for someone to do all the work for them (this is guided, not entirely done-for-you)

* Anyone not willing to be honest about what’s broken

# **What We Actually Work On**

While every engagement is different, the types of things we typically identify and address fall into a few categories:

### **Leveraging Existing Tools & Tech**

Most businesses are already paying for tools they’re underutilizing. Before recommending anything new, we look at what’s already in place and how to get more out of it. Examples include better use of Google Workspace (Drive organization, shared calendars, Docs workflows), getting more value from a ChatGPT or AI subscription beyond basic chat, actually adopting the project management or CRM tool they’re already paying for, and cleaning up shared drives and file organization so the team can actually find what they need.

### **Process & Delegation**

Identifying the processes that live in the owner’s head and getting them documented, simplified, or handed off. This might be as straightforward as writing down how something gets done so someone else can do it, or restructuring a workflow so it doesn’t require the owner’s involvement at every step.

### **Capacity & Team Development**

Sometimes the bottleneck isn’t the process — it’s that a key person on the team needs support or development in a specific area. If a particular function of the business is consuming the owner’s time because the team needs constant guidance to deliver in that area, that’s something we’d identify and plan around.

### **Smart Adoption of New Tools**

When there is a genuine gap that requires a new tool or technology, we help the participant evaluate options based on their actual needs, budget, and team’s ability to adopt it — not based on hype or what’s trending.

# **Value Proposition**

## **One-Liner**

*Stop spinning your wheels. Get a clear, prioritized plan to fix what’s actually holding your business back — in 8 weeks, with expert guidance every step of the way.*

## **The Expanded Pitch**

You started this business because you’re good at what you do. But now you spend more time managing chaos than doing the work that matters. Your team needs you for every decision. Your systems live in your head. You’ve heard AI can help, but you don’t have time to figure out what’s real.

Ops Basecamp is 8 weeks of structured, 1-on-1 work designed to cut through the noise. It starts with a kickoff conversation where we get clear on your goals and what you already know needs attention. Then a simple discovery process captures what’s actually happening in your day-to-day. Week by week, we turn all of that into a clear, prioritized roadmap you can actually execute.

Along the way, you’ll start implementing changes — not just planning them. Some you’ll handle with your team. Others we’ll work through together. You’ll walk away with quick wins already in motion, a 90-day plan tailored to your business, and the clarity to know exactly what to focus on next.

# **Program Structure: Week by Week**

The program runs for 8 weeks: a kickoff session, a 2-week self-guided discovery phase, and 5 weekly 60-minute 1-on-1 working sessions. The total commitment is 6 sessions of 60 minutes each, plus 5–10 minutes per day during the discovery phase.

### **Week 1: Kickoff Call & Onboarding**

A 60-minute onboarding session to set the foundation. We cover how the discovery tool works, what kinds of entries to capture (problems, opportunities, goals, ideas, frustrations), and how to get the most out of the process. More importantly, this is the first real conversation — we identify the participant’s specific goals, the areas they already know need attention, and what they’re hoping to get out of the program. This ensures the entire engagement is shaped around their business, not a generic framework.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Onboard the participant on the discovery tool. Facilitate an open conversation to surface initial goals, known pain points, and priorities. Set expectations for the discovery phase. | Come ready to talk openly about where their business is at. No prep needed — just honesty about what’s working and what isn’t. |

### **Weeks 2–3: Discovery Phase**

Over two weeks, participants use the voice-capture tool to record what’s on their mind as it comes up — problems, opportunities, goals, tools they’ve noticed, frustrations, ideas. No structure required, just honest brain-dumps. The goal is to capture the reality of their day-to-day in their own words, building a rich picture of where the business actually is versus where they want it to be.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Reviews all entries using AI-assisted pattern analysis to identify themes, root causes, and quick-win opportunities. Cross-references discovery data with the goals and priorities surfaced in the kickoff call. Begins forming hypotheses about what’s really driving the issues they’re experiencing. | 5–10 minutes per day, whenever something comes to mind. The more honest and frequent, the better the insights. |

### **Week 4: Discovery Debrief & Assessment**

First working session after the discovery phase. Greg presents what he’s found: key themes, patterns, root causes, and initial observations. Together, they map the current state — where time is going, where things break down, what’s working, and how the discovery data connects back to the goals they identified in Week 1\.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Deliver the Discovery Debrief — a structured overview of captured inputs organized by theme, with initial root cause analysis and connections to their stated goals. | Come prepared to validate, correct, and expand on what Greg presents. This is where the real picture comes into focus. |

### **Week 5: Priority Mapping & Quick Wins**

Identify the 3–5 highest-impact areas for improvement. Assess each for effort vs. impact. Distinguish between quick wins that can start immediately and longer-term structural changes. Where possible, we identify opportunities to better leverage tools and systems already in place — because most businesses are sitting on untapped potential in what they already have.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Facilitate prioritization using a simple impact/effort framework. Identify specific quick wins and any existing tools or tech that are underutilized. Provide actionable direction on where to start. | Make decisions about what matters most right now. Commit to implementing at least one quick win before the next session. |

### **Week 6: Roadmap Build**

Construct a 90-day operational roadmap. Sequence the priorities identified in Week 5 into a realistic timeline. Identify dependencies — what skills, data, or tools need to be in place first. This is also where we start identifying which solutions can be implemented by their team independently, which ones benefit from guided support, and which might require additional hands-on services.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Build the roadmap document collaboratively during the session. Flag opportunities for self-directed implementation vs. guided vs. supported engagement. | Commit to timelines and identify who on their team will be involved in executing each item. |

### **Week 7: Obstacle Clearing & Implementation Support**

Address what’s gotten stuck. Review progress on quick wins. Troubleshoot blockers. Adjust the roadmap based on real-world feedback. If implementation opportunities have surfaced — whether it’s a process change the team is executing or a tool adoption that’s underway — we work through the specifics of making it stick.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem-solve in real time. Bring outside perspective and pattern recognition from other industries. Support active implementation efforts. | Come with honest updates — what worked, what didn’t, what they’re avoiding. |

### **Week 8: Handoff & Next Steps**

Final session. Review the complete roadmap, progress to date, and what’s next. The participant leaves with a clear, self-guided plan they can execute independently — plus clarity on where additional support would accelerate their progress if they choose to pursue it.

| Greg’s Role | Participant’s Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| Deliver the final roadmap document and a summary of key insights and recommendations. Identify any areas where continued support could add value. | Walk away with clarity, confidence, and a plan they own. |

# **Implementation During the Program**

Ops Basecamp isn’t just a planning exercise. During the 8 weeks, there will be real opportunities to put solutions in place. How that happens depends on what we find and what makes sense for the participant:

### **Self-Directed Implementation**

In many cases, we’ll identify a solution in our sessions and the participant takes it to their team to implement independently. This could be documenting a process, reorganizing a shared drive, rolling out a feature in a tool they already have, or making a specific delegation change. No additional cost — this is part of the program.

### **Guided Implementation**

Some solutions benefit from ongoing guidance during our weekly sessions. The participant and their team do the work, but we use session time to troubleshoot, adjust, and keep things on track. Also part of the program.

### **Additional Hands-On Services**

In some cases, we’ll identify work that goes beyond what the participant or their team can handle on their own — or where bringing in outside support would dramatically accelerate progress. This might include building a specific tool or workflow for the team, working directly with team members to develop capabilities in a specific area, or providing targeted support to a key person whose growth would directly reduce the owner’s operational burden.

These services are separate from the Ops Basecamp program fee and would be scoped and quoted individually. The pilot program’s Revelstoke-local format makes this kind of hands-on support particularly practical.

# **What Participants Walk Away With**

1. **A Prioritized 90-Day Roadmap** — A clear, sequenced plan covering what to tackle first, what depends on what, and realistic timelines. Not generic advice — built from their own inputs, their own goals, and their business reality.

2. **Quick Wins Already in Motion** — By mid-program, participants will have implemented at least one meaningful change. Momentum matters more than perfection.

3. **Clarity on What to Hire, Build, or Buy** — Instead of guessing about the next tool, hire, or process change, they’ll know exactly what’s needed and in what order. Including what they can stop paying for.

4. **A Trusted Operational Advisor** — Someone who understands their business, their challenges, and their goals — and can help when the next question comes up.

# **Pricing**

## **Pilot Cohort: $750**

This is the founding cohort price. Future cohorts will be priced higher. Participants in the pilot are getting early access to a program that will evolve based on their experience and feedback.

| Detail | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Price** | $750 (paid in advance) |
| **Payment** | Full payment at enrollment |
| **Cohort Size** | 6–8 participants (first come, first served) |
| **Duration** | 8 weeks total |
| **Sessions** | 6 x 60-minute 1-on-1 sessions (kickoff \+ 5 working sessions) |
| **Discovery Phase** | 2 weeks of self-guided voice capture between kickoff and working sessions |
| **Includes** | Discovery tools, all session time, roadmap document, background analysis |
| **Does Not Include** | Additional hands-on services identified during the program (quoted separately) |
| **Format** | In-person preferred (Revelstoke, BC) / Virtual available |

## **Pricing Rationale**

At $750 for 6 hours of direct 1-on-1 time plus discovery analysis and a custom roadmap, this is deliberately underpriced for the pilot. The goal is to fill the cohort quickly, deliver exceptional value, and build testimonials and case studies for future cohorts.

For reference, comparable consulting engagements in this space typically run $2,000–$5,000+ for similar scope. Future cohorts will be priced at $1,500–$2,000.

The pilot price positions this as a “no-brainer” for the right participant: serious enough to filter out tire-kickers, accessible enough that it’s not a major risk. The additional services pathway also creates natural revenue opportunity beyond the program fee.

# **Program Name: “Ops Basecamp”**

## **Why This Name**

Basecamp works on multiple levels for this offering and this audience:

* Mountain town resonance — Revelstoke locals immediately get the metaphor. Basecamp is where you prepare, assess conditions, and plan your route before the real climb.

* Starting point, not the summit — This program isn’t claiming to solve everything. It’s the foundation. The clarity you need before you can move with confidence.

* “Ops” signals operations — This isn’t life coaching or business mindset work. It’s about how your business actually runs.

* Natural upsell framing — If Basecamp is the starting point, the next engagement is the ascent. No need to say this out loud — it’s structurally implied.

## **Alternative Names Considered**

* The Clarity Sprint — Good but feels techy/startup-y for this audience

* The Ops Accelerator — Overused term, sounds like an incubator program

* Ground Floor — Real estate connotations, less evocative

* The Builder’s Playbook — Construction-heavy, limits cross-industry appeal
