# Claude Code Prompt: Rename "Ops Basecamp" to "Owner Tactics" on strategy-kickoff.html

## Task

Rename the program from "Ops Basecamp" to "Owner Tactics" across the file `services/strategy-kickoff.html` (and any other files that reference it — check the nav, any shared layout/header files, and the sitemap if one exists).

This is a naming change with some copy adjustments — not a redesign. Keep the structure, styling, and layout exactly as they are.

## The Name Change

**Old name:** Ops Basecamp  
**New name:** Owner Tactics

"Owner Tactics" is the permanent service name. "Pilot" is not part of the name — it's contextual language used around pricing and exclusivity to signal that this is a founding cohort with discounted pricing.

## Specific Changes Needed

### Page title / meta
- **Title tag:** Change from "Ops Basecamp | Operational Consulting for Revelstoke Small Businesses" → "Owner Tactics | Operational Consulting for Revelstoke Small Businesses"
- **Meta description:** Replace any instance of "Ops Basecamp" with "Owner Tactics"
- **OG tags:** Update og:title if present

### Navigation
- Update any nav links that say "Ops Basecamp" → "Owner Tactics"
- Check shared header/nav components — this may be defined in a layout file, not just this page

### Hero section
- No changes to headline or subheadline (they don't mention the program name)
- No changes to CTA or micro-copy

### "What This Is" section
- Replace: "Ops Basecamp is an 8-week, 1-on-1 program that starts with..."
- With: "Owner Tactics is an 8-week, 1-on-1 engagement that starts with..."
- Note the word change: "program" → "engagement" — use "engagement" consistently when referring to Owner Tactics throughout the page. Avoid "program" and "course."

### "Who's Behind This" / About section
- Replace: "Ops Basecamp is the answer to that."
- With: "Owner Tactics is the answer to that."

### Pricing section
- The heading currently reads "Pricing — Revelstoke Pilot Cohort" — keep this as-is, the pilot language here is intentional
- No other changes needed in pricing

### FAQ section
- Scan all FAQ answers for any mention of "Ops Basecamp" and replace with "Owner Tactics"

### Footer / sticky CTA
- No changes needed unless the program name appears (it shouldn't based on current content)

### Schema markup (JSON-LD)
- If there's LocalBusiness or Service schema in the page, update the service name from "Ops Basecamp" to "Owner Tactics"

### Any other files
- Search the entire project for "Ops Basecamp" (case-insensitive) and replace with "Owner Tactics" wherever it appears — this may include sitemap.xml, any blog posts or linked pages, robots.txt references, etc.
- **Do NOT rename the file** from `strategy-kickoff.html` — keep the URL the same to avoid breaking any shared links

## What NOT to Change
- Do not change the page structure, layout, or styling
- Do not change the headline, subheadline, CTA copy, or pricing
- Do not change the URL/filename
- Do not rewrite copy beyond the specific replacements listed above
- Do not add or remove any sections
