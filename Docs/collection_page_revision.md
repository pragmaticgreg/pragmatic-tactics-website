You are absolutely right to want to change this layout. Presenting two paid services and a free contact option in the exact same visual weight (three columns) creates "cognitive overload." It treats a free introductory step like a heavy buying decision, which can cause visitors to freeze and take no action at all.

Moving to a **"2 Services + 1 Safety Net"** structure is a major UX and marketing best practice.

Here is a comprehensive strategy to rework your collection page, improve the differentiation between the two services, and implement marketing/SEO best practices.

### 1. The New Layout Strategy (Wireframe Flow)

Instead of a flat grid, structure the page as a journey that guides the user:

* **Section 1: The Hero (Value Proposition).** Keep your strong headline, but optimize it slightly for SEO (see below).
* **Section 2: The Two Core Services (2-Column Grid).** Present "Discovery" and "Owner Tactics" side-by-side. Visually differentiate them by *readiness* rather than just features.
* **Section 3: The "Safety Net" (Centered Block).** This replaces your 3rd column. It should be a full-width, differently colored band right below the services.
* *Headline:* "Not sure which path is right for you?"
* *Copy:* "No pressure, no pitch. Let's have a 15-minute casual conversation to figure out what makes sense for your business."
* *Button:* "Book a Free Intro Call"


* **Section 4: The Comparison / "Which One is Right?" Table.** Your current table is great. Keep it below the safety net for the analytical buyers who need to see the side-by-side specs.
* **Section 5: The "Who We Help" (Your Execution section).** Expand on the "Built for Businesses That Build, Make, and Deliver" section.
* **Section 6: Trust / Social Proof (Highly Recommended).** You desperately need at least one or two short testimonials on this page.

### 2. Marketing & Positioning Best Practices

Right now, your two services are hard to differentiate at a glance because the pricing is so similar ($750 vs $800), but the timelines are drastically different (8 weeks vs 1-2 weeks).

You need to clearly position them based on **"What is the client's immediate problem?"**

**Service A: Discovery ($800)**

* **Position as:** The Diagnostic / The Blueprint.
* **Who it’s for:** The overwhelmed owner who knows things are broken but doesn't know *where* to start fixing them.
* **New Subheadline idea:** "Find the bottlenecks. Get a clear roadmap."
* **UI Polish:** Make this the logical "First Step" for most new clients.

**Service B: Owner Tactics ($750)**

* **Position as:** The Execution Partnership.
* **Who it’s for:** The owner who knows what needs to be fixed but lacks the time, accountability, or expertise to actually implement the changes.
* **New Subheadline idea:** "8 weeks of hands-on implementation to win your time back."
* *(Note on Pricing Strategy: $750 for 8 weeks of 1-on-1 consulting is incredibly cheap and might actually lower the perceived value of your expertise compared to an $800 one-week assessment. You may want to evaluate raising this price as you get busier to reflect the massive value of 8 weeks of your time).*

### 3. SEO & Copywriting Polish

Currently, your copy is very authentic and punchy (no jargon, no fluff), which is fantastic. However, we need to weave in some SEO keywords so Google knows *what* you actually do.

* **Optimize the H1/Hero:** * *Current:* "Real Fixes for How Your Business Actually Runs"
* *Better SEO tweak:* Keep the big text, but add a descriptive H2 right above or below it: "Operational Consulting for Trades, Manufacturing & E-Commerce: **Real Fixes for How Your Business Actually Runs.**"


* **Use Benefit-Driven Bullet Points:** Under your services, change the features to benefits.
* *Instead of:* "Written operations assessment"
* *Try:* "A written assessment showing exactly where you are losing time and money."
* *Instead of:* "Weekly working sessions"
* *Try:* "Weekly working sessions to force momentum and get things done."


* **Keyword Integration:** Make sure phrases like "Small Business Operations Consulting," "Workflow Optimization," "Business Systems Consultant," and "Operational Roadmap" appear naturally in the text, particularly in the "Built for Businesses That Build" section.

### Summary of Next Steps for the Redesign:

1. **Break the 3-column layout.** Put Discovery on the left, Owner Tactics on the right.
2. **Add a full-width banner underneath** for the 15-minute call.
3. **Add a "Who is this for?" micro-sentence** above each of the two services to instantly guide the user.
4. **Insert 1-2 testimonials** to build immediate trust before they have to choose a service.
