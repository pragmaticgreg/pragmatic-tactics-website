## Hero — Subheadline

**Current:**
> 8 weeks. 1-on-1. We dig into your business together and build a clear plan around what will make the biggest difference.

**Revised:**
> 8 weeks. 1-on-1. We figure out what's costing you the most time, put real fixes in place, and give you a clear path forward.

## What This Is

**Current:**
> Ops Basecamp is an 8-week, 1-on-1 program that starts with understanding your business and where your time is actually going — not a template. Through a guided discovery process and weekly working sessions, we figure out what's creating the most drag and where small changes will make the biggest difference. You walk away with a clear plan and changes already in motion.

**Revised:**
> Owner Tactics is an 8-week, 1-on-1 engagement built entirely around your business — not a template or a generic framework. We start by understanding where your time is actually going and what's creating the most drag. Then through weekly working sessions, we prioritize what matters, put solutions in place, and build a roadmap for what comes next. This isn't just a plan on paper — you'll have real changes implemented before the 8 weeks are up.

## What We Work On — Accordion Expanded Content

### Leveraging What You Already Have

**Current:**
> Before recommending anything new, we look at what's already in place — Google Workspace, project management tools, shared drives, existing subscriptions — and figure out how to actually get value from them. Sometimes the biggest wins come from using what you're already paying for.

Sometimes the biggest wins come from using what you're already paying for. We'll identify the gaps and help you or your team put the changes in place during the engagement.

### AI & Modern Tools — Cut Through the Hype

**Current:**
> Part of the program can include working with you to understand how AI tools can support your own day-to-day as a business leader — from decision-making to communication to planning. We also look at practical use cases for your team: where these tools can reduce repetitive work, improve quality, or free up capacity. The goal isn't to chase trends — it's to find what's genuinely useful for how your business actually operates.

### Delegation — Get It Out of Your Head

No changes.

### Your Team — Do More Without Hiring More

**Current:**
> Sometimes the bottleneck isn't the process — it's that a key person needs support in a specific area. If a particular function of your business is consuming your time because the team needs constant guidance there, that's something we'd identify and build a plan around.

> Sometimes the bottleneck isn't the process — it's that a key person needs support in a specific area. If a particular function of your business is consuming your time because the team needs constant guidance there, we'll flag it and work on a solution — whether that's something your team can implement on their own, or something I come in and help with directly.

## Who's Behind This — Paragraph 2

**Current:**
> I live and work in Revelstoke. I run my own businesses here. This program exists because I kept having the same conversation with local owners: "I know things need to change, I just don't know where to start." Ops Basecamp is the answer to that.

**Revised:**
> I live and work in Revelstoke. I run my own businesses here. I built Owner Tactics because I kept having the same conversation with local owners: "I know things need to change, I just don't know where to start." This is the answer to that — structured, hands-on, and built around what you actually need.

## FAQ Revisions

### "Is this coaching?"

**Current:**
> Not exactly. Think of it as having someone in your corner for 8 weeks who helps you figure out where your time and energy should actually go — and then helps you make those changes. We're focused on what's real in your business, not mindset.

**Revised:**
> Not exactly. Think of it as having someone in your corner for 8 weeks who helps you figure out where your time and energy should actually go — and then works with you to make real changes. We're not here to motivate you. We're here to fix what's not working.

### "What industries does this work for?"

**Current:**
> Any. The program is built around your specific business, not a template. Participants will come from different industries — trades, services, retail, hospitality, etc.

**Revised:**
> Any. Every engagement is built around your specific business, not a template. Participants come from different industries — trades, services, retail, hospitality, etc.

### "What if we identify something that needs more hands-on help?"

**Current:**
> Great — that's actually a feature. If we find work that goes beyond what your team can handle alone, we can scope additional support separately. The Revelstoke-local format makes this practical.

**Revised:**
> That's the whole point. If we find something that needs more than guidance — whether it's building a tool for your team, working directly with a key person, or implementing a system — I can come in and do that work. Being local in Revelstoke makes this practical in a way that remote consulting can't.
