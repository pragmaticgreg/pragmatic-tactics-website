COLOR VARIATIONS GENERATOR
Generate n = 3 files
Instructions
Look at the design that has been attached.
Create 3 different versions of that same design. Make each one look different by changing only the color and small design elements (eg: borders, shadows, corner radius, backgrounds, fonts, etc) but keep the same structure, sizing, content, and functionality.
Follow any additional instructions given in the prompt.
File Management
Check if a "variations" folder exists
If it exists:
Rename the reference design to "source.html"
Delete any other files in the folder
If "source.html" already exists, delete the old one first
If no "variations" folder exists:
Create the "variations" folder
Put the reference design in as "source.html"
Create Files
Make these files in the variations folder:
design1.html
design2.html
design3.html
Continue to design{n}.html if more than 3 requested
Each design should be completely different visually but work the same way.
